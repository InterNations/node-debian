There is nothing official about this package config.

The mainstream Debian package contains everything you need to know about the
relevant licenses and copyright of everything here.

As for the package config itself, I created some of it, and copied some of
it from the official Debian package. Do what you want with it. Whatever
happens is your problem :)
